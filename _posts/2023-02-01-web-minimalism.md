## Introduction

The aim of this article to make a minimal website, in which no unnecessary bloat is present.
If you want to make a website whose sole aim is to provide information to other people
you should consider following principles of minimalism design.

You can watch this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQa0BajKB4Q> for a slight introduction.

## Principles of minimalism design for web page

Here are some things you should keep in mind while creating a web-page (or for any content):

- You should provide an outline to what you are providing.
  It improves user experience as it helps someone to find what they are looking for easily.
- Don't include unnecessary image, text, quotes.
  Anything irrelevant should be removed.
  Don't include images with big file size, keep the file size so that the image is clearly visible.
  I see many blog post on medium blog site with unnecessary images.
- Don't use bad UI design, like centring and justifying text in paragraphs.
- Don't include javascript if not needed.
- If you want to include ads, limit there numbers and keep their position out of content.
- Use HTML(hyper text markup language) semantic tags, don't fill webpage with `divs`.
  You should use correct tags and validate html, this improves accessibility and improves structure of web page.
  Here are some semantic tags you may need to use as a programmer:
    - `<code>` inline code
    - `<kbd>` keyboard input, some shortcut
    - `<pre>` preformatted text, no space, tabs are ignores in it, and also no line spaces are ignored. Use this for code blocks.
    - `<samp>` for output of a code, use this

These are basic and most important one.

## Why minimalism? - problem with modern web

Here are some of problems with modern web which I often notice:

- Main content(what you visited the site for) don't have focus, it's covered all over with ad's.
  You can have ad's and also have focus over content.
- Useless java script for interactivity which no one needed, and it's often broken for some browsers.
- Bad UI design and UX, no **text hierarchy**, **excessive use of emoji**,
  unnecessary buttons, not enough spacing and padding, etc.
- Bad logic in forms, not everyone have a last name, or middle name, etc.
- Infinite scroll, please use pagination, or at least give a option for switching to it.
