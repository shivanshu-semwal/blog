## Introduction

The aim of this article to make a minimal website, in which no unnecessary bloat is present.
If you want to make a website whose sole aim is to provide information to other.
You should follow principles of minimalism design.

## Principles

Here are some things you should keep in mind while creating a web-page (or for any content):

- You should provide an outline to what you are providing.
  It improves user experience as it helps someone to find what they are looking for easily.
- Don't include unnecessary image, text, quotes.
  Anything irrelevant should be removed.
  Don't include images with big size, keep the size so that the image is clearly visible.
  I see many blog post on medium with unnecessary images.
- Don't use bad UI design, like centring and justifying text in paragraphs.
- Don't include javascript if not needed.

## Semantics

- Uae HTML(hyper text markup language) semantic tags, don't fill it with `divs`.

You should use correct tags and validate html,
this improves accessibility and improves structure of web page.

- `<!-- use comments in html -->`
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` type of document
- `<a>` for links
- `<article>` defines an article
- `<b>` for bold
- `<blockquote>` for quotes
- `<br>` newline
- `<code>` defines some code, use `monospace` font
- `<details>` want summary and title, type content which can be collapsed
- `<div>` divide page to make some layout and responsive, don't use too many divs
- `<em>` emphasis
- `<footer>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`

How to write code in html:

- `<code>` inline code
- `<kbd>` keyboard input, some shortcut
- `<pre>` preformatted text, no space, tabs are ignores in it,
  and also no line spaces are ignored. Use this for code blocks.
- `<samp>` for output of a code, use this

## Problem with modern web

Here are some of my problems with modern web

- content don't have focus, what you visited the site for, it's covered with ad's all over
  and we can't focus on what we visited for. You can have ad's and also have focus over content.
- useless java script for interactivity which no one needed, and it's often broken.
- bad ui design and ux, no text hierarchy, excessive use of emoji,
  unnecessary buttons, not enough spacing etc.
- bad logic in forms, not everyone have a last name.
- infinite scroll, please use pagination, or at least give a option for switching to it

## Some Example

So many people start making website to showcase how a minimal site should be:

- <https://motherfuckingwebsite.com> original
    - <http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com> ([source](https://github.com/wersimmon/BetterMotherfuckingWebsite-css))
    - <https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com>
    - <https://evenbettermotherfucking.website> ([source](https://github.com/setetres/evenbettermotherfuckingwebsite))
