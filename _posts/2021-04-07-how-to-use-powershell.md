PowerShell is new shell for windows and is cross platform shell.

Form [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerShell)

> PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language. Initially a Windows component only, known as Windows PowerShell, it was made open-source and cross-platform on 18 August 2016 with the introduction of PowerShell Core. The former is built on the .NET Framework, the latter on .NET Core.

So it is clear that there are two versions of powershell

- PowerShell Core - made on .NET Core - cross platform
- PowerShell - made on .NET Framework - for windows - contains some modules which are windows specific
