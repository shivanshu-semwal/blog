mathjax renders math equations in a better format. It can be used with markdown, and static site generators.

## Setup

- Visit mathjax website, <https://www.mathjax.org/>. There you can see various methods of integration.
- The most simple one is Web Integration.

For v3 you have to add this to you html page:

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```

For v2,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```

## Usage

First you have to write some math, mostly it is same as used in latex. For e.g. `ax^2 + bx + c`.
Now you have to use some delimiters to enclose this text so that it can be rendered by mathjax.
Here is what it looks after rendering,

- Inline $ax^2 + bx + c$
- Block

$$
ax^2 + bx + c
$$

- The default math delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\[...\]` for displayed mathematics, and `\(...\)` for in-line mathematics.
- Also note that, `$...$` in-line delimiters are not used by default (because dollar signs appear too often in non-mathematical settings like in case of money).
- Also note that if you are using a static site generator, you parser might remove `\` from `\(` and inline math won't work,
  you can either than change config and use `$` or use `\\(`

## Configuration

This is a basic way to configure mathjax.

```html
<script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
  MathJax.Hub.Config({tex2jax: {inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']]}});
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" async
  src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.7/latest.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
```

Another way you can do the same things is,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" async
    src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.3/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
    MathJax.Hub.Config({
        tex2jax: {
            inlineMath: [["$", "$"], ["\\(", "\\)"]],
            processEscapes: true
        }
    });
</script>
```

Also you can always refer to documentation for more details, <https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/>.
