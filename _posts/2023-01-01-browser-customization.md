privacy concerns. My personal choice is firefox.

> <https://add0n.com/index.html>, here you can find more extensions which are open-source

You should use a password manager and not store password on browser.
It will help you to not fall for phishing sites. I use bitwarden password manger.

Also you can use a bookmark manager extension, which will sync you bookmarks across browsers.
