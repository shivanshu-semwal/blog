This blog post is to help you guide in using modern web in a productive manner.

## Browser

First step is you should choose a browser which is open source, and choose a version which has no
privacy concerns. My personal choice is firefox. Here are some other:

- Firefox
- Librewolf
- Chromium

## Browser Extensions

Now after this you can install these extensions according to your need.
Also you should use extensions which are open source and actively maintained.

- `stylus`
    - Use: for injecting custom css on websites, you can also search for stylesheets mad by other people and use them.

## Password Manager

Next you should install a password manager.
Storing password on browser may be affected by many vulnerabilities, and also syncing them is a problem.
It will also help you to not fall for phishing sites. I use bitwarden password manger.

## Bookmark Manager

A bookmark manager extension is necessary for modern web where we have so many bookmarks.
Bookmark manager will sync you bookmarks across browsers.

## Search Engine

Use a privacy oriented search engine, also if that is not possible at least try switching search engine
in months and you will notice which one fits your need.

## Start Page

There are many extensions for this purpose, you can also make you own start page, or use some extension which will
show bookmarks as your start page.
